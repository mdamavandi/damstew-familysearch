# FamilySearch Products

At present we have two areas of focus for our apps... [Tools](#tool-apps) and [Entertainment](#entertainment-apps)

## Tool Apps

These tools are meant to help the FamilySearch user with discovering information that may not be easy to discover when using FamilySeach.org, such as the named relationship between themselves and those they are researching.

- [ ] Display the user's relationship to the person
