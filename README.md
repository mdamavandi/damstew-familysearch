# FamilySearch Products

At present we have two areas of focus for our apps... [Tools](#tool-apps) and [Entertainment](#entertainment-apps)

## Tool Apps

These tools are meant to help the FamilySearch user with discovering information that may not be easy to discover when using FamilySeach.org, such as the named relationship between themselves and those they are researching. Here's the state of things on our radar:

### How Am I Related
Allow a FamilySearch.org user to discover their relationship to another person.

Here's how we're progressing:
- [ ] Have a site for the app
- [ ] Allow user to connect to their FamilySearch profile
- [ ] Allow user to enter a person ID
- [ ] Display the user's relationship to the person

## Entertainment Apps
There are some fun things we'd like to build as well.
